## About the project
---
* This project was developed using React.js and Tailwind.css and was meant to be a landing page for recently incubated YC startup, Matterport.
* I used the React framework and Tailwind.css because react allows for easy implmentation of front end designs and fucntionality as the use of its many packages such as react router and its hooks are easy to use. I used Tailwind.css because of its easy syntax and ability to create responsive web pages easily.
